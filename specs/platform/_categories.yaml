# Platform tier categories (mostly independent, spec-system is meta)

    priority: 0
    status: "draft"
    created: "2026-02-07"
    is-meta: true
    precedence:
      rationale: "Spec-System is meta (specs about specs); defines framework for all category specs"
      note: "Roughly equal priority with IaC-Linting; both foundational for platform"
    
  - category: iac-linting
    spec-id: lint-001
    version: "1.0.0-draft"
    file: iac-linting/spec.md
    name: "IaC Linting & Quality"
    description: "Code quality standards for Bicep, Terraform, PowerShell, YAML; linting rules and exceptions"
    priority: 0
    status: "draft"
    created: "2026-02-07"
    precedence:
      rationale: "Technical standard for code quality; roughly equal with Spec-System as foundation"
    applies-to: [infrastructure, artifacts]

    version: "1.0.0"

    priority: 1
    status: "published"
    created: "2026-02-06"
    precedence:
      rationale: "Structural standard; depends on Spec-System and IaC-Linting"
    depends-on:
      - tier: platform
        category: spec-system
        spec-id: spec-001

      - tier: platform
        category: iac-linting
        spec-id: lint-001
        reason: "Artifacts in repository must follow linting standards"

    description: "Azure Policy definitions, enforcement rules, remediation, compliance automation"
    priority: 2
    status: "draft"
    created: "2026-02-07"
    precedence:
      rationale: "Reactive enforcement layer; implements business/security requirements"
      note: "Lower priority than standards; enforces decisions made by other tiers"
    depends-on:
      - tier: business
        category: compliance-framework
