    file: data-protection/spec.md
    name: "Data Protection"
    description: "Encryption (AES-256), key management, key rotation (90 days), HSM requirements"
    priority: 0
    status: "published"
    created: "2026-02-06"
    precedence:
      rationale: "Encryption is foundational and non-negotiable; overrides cost and other optimization"
      wins-over: [access-control, audit-logging, business/cost]
    overrides:
      - tier: business
        category: cost
        spec-id: cost-001
        reason: "Data protection requirements (HSM, AES-256, key rotation) are non-negotiable and override cost optimization"
    
  - category: access-control
    spec-id: ac-001
    version: "1.0.0-draft"
    file: access-control/spec.md
    name: "Access Control"
    description: "Authentication, authorization, RBAC, SSH keys only (no passwords), MFA where applicable"
    priority: 0
    status: "draft"
    created: "2026-02-07"
    precedence:
      rationale: "Access control is foundational; nearly equal priority with data protection"
      wins-over: [audit-logging, business/governance]
      equivalent-to: [data-protection]
    connection: "Access Control and Data Protection are roughly equal; both precede Audit-Logging"

    version: "1.0.0-draft"
    file: audit-logging/spec.md

    priority: 1
    status: "draft"
    created: "2026-02-07"
    precedence:
      rationale: "Audit logging enables detection; lower priority than access control and data protection"
