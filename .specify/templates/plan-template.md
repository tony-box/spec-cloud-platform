## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check: Tier Alignment & Spec Cascading

*GATE: Must verify this spec aligns with parent tier constraints before Phase 0 research.*

- **Spec Tier**: [business | security | infrastructure | application]
- **Parent Tier Specs**: [Reference to specs in next-higher tier that constrain this spec]
- **Derived Constraints**: [List specific rules, limits, or requirements inherited from parent tier]
- **Artifact Traceability**: This spec will generate the following outputs (AI-assisted, human-reviewed):
  - [e.g., "Bicep modules for cost-optimized VMs", "Azure Policy definitions", "GitHub Actions pipelines", "Application deployment manifests"]

*Re-check after Phase 1 design to ensure generated artifacts align with all tier constraints.*

## Spec Organization & Four-Tier Structure

### Business-Tier Specifications (`/specs/business/`)
Operational requirements, budgets, cost targets, SLAs, business objectives. Platform updates at this level cascade through all downstream tiers.

### Security-Tier Specifications (`/specs/security/`)
Compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO), policy-as-code rules, threat models. Derived from business requirements; constrains infrastructure and application choices.

### Infrastructure-Tier Specifications (`/specs/infrastructure/`)
Azure landing zones, networking design, IaC module catalogs, pipeline templates, observability policies. Derived from business + security tiers; used by application teams.

### Application-Tier Specifications (`/specs/application/`)
Application architecture, feature specs, performance SLAs, deployment patterns. Constrained by business, security, and infrastructure tiers.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
